## [Get Current Release Here](https://github.com/child-duckling/caltran-cameras)
A window wrapper to make the live cameras widget-like built off of Caltrans' camera webpage

This uses deep links to open the windows. Theres is a lot of code for something so simple, so expect some optimisation updates.
